# Samurai_fighter

This is my first try at making a javascript game. I chose to do a basic 2d fighting game. 

this game is supported for resolutions 1024 x 768 and above

controls for the game are:

player 1:

w : jump
a : move left
d : move right
spacebar: attack

player 2: 

arrow up: jump
arrow left: move left
arrow right : move right
arrow down : attack
